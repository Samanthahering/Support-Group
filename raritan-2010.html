        The annual Ribbon Awareness Educational Program was held at Frelinghuysen Park. Blue and Gray ribbons
        were tied to the trees around the park and to the trees on Somerset Street to help to start the conversation
        about mental disorders. Special thank you to Congressman Frelinghuysen for his participation, Girl Scout Troop #1069 for
        helping to make the ribbons and for baking. To Wegmans for water donations and to
        <a href="https://www.scottsflorist.net" target="_blank"> Scott's Florist</a>
        for donating the ribbon.
