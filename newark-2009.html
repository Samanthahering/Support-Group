      <h3>Newark, NJ -- Sunday, June 16, 2009</h3>
      <p style= "font-size: 18px">
        To promote the first bilingual mental health support group in the North Ironbound, co-founders, Augusta
        Santos & Martha Silva gave a speech after Mass to the parishioners of Our Lady of Fatima Church on the
        importance of being knowledgeable on the symptoms of depression/signs of suicide. This support group
        aims to educate the Portuguese and Spanish-speaking families who have loved ones struggling with mental
        disorders by providing understanding, resources, coping skills, HOPE and especially to know that they
        are not alone!! Families that have been helped by a mental health support group knows how blessed they
        were to have such a group available. Sadly, the stigma that these cultures have and the language barrier
        has prevented many families from benefiting from English-speaking support groups.
