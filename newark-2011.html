      <p style= "font-size: 18px">
        In recognition of Mental Health Month, the João José ‘John’ Santos Charitable Organization, whose mission
        is to educate families and communities on their quest to understanding mental illness in order to prevent
        further suicides, held their annual Ribbon Awareness Educational Project during the month of May in eight
        communities throughout Central Jersey -- 740 red ribbons with the words: 'talk about mental illness'
        written were affixed to the trees of these municipalities’ to increase public awareness for mental
        disorders for those who walk, run, bicycle or drive these Towns during the month of May.

        <h2>Ribbon Awarness Campaign</h2>
        <p style= "font-size: 18px">
          Mental disorders and suicides happen in everyone’s communities, and the stigma associated with this
          will diminish only through educating societies. Awareness and education is key in replacing the
          powerless six-letter word ‘stigma’ with the powerful nine-letter word ‘EDUCATION’, so that families
          can begin discussing these illnesses in the same they talk about other health issues starting TODAY!
          Special gratitude to the wonderful volunteers for helping to tie the ribbons to the trees in Raritan,
          Somerville, Manville, Bound Brook, Flemington.
